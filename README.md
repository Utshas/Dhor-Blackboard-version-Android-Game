# Dhor-Blackboard-version-Android-Game
This is an android game that has a theif and you have to beat him by tapping him.
I have used "CountDownTimer" to count down time and media player for game music. There is also a splash screen. This game has two different modes... survival mode- where if you miss to beat thief, the game will be over and a Time Limit mode. Where, you will get 30 second time, and we will see how many time you can beat the theif within this 30 second.
I have also used typeface here in order to use a customize font.
This game also shows tips.
Basically this game was designed for my 6 year old cousin and he really liked it.
